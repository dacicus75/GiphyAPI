# GiphyAPI
This was created using HTML CSS Javascript and Jquery
Also it pulls an API from GIPHY

I made an array of SCI-FI tv shows and made buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
User can add a new TV Show from the form.  The show(s) will be added to the array of TV shows and added as a new button
The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
